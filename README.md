WhatsApi-Android
================

This is a WhatsApp client written in Java. It's a fork from WhatsApi4J, which is based on Chat-API.
The goal of this fork is to make a totally new WhatsApp client for Android and let ourselves understand how the WhatsApp protocol works.

(At this moment you can only request and obtain your password, and sending and receiving text messages. More features are in development.)
