WhatsApi-Android
================

This is a WhatsApp client written in Java. It's a ported code from the Chat-API which is written in PHP.
The goal of this app is to make a totally new WhatsApp client for Android and let ourselves understand how the WhatsApp protocol works.

(At this moment you can only request and obtain your WhatsApp password, also sending and receiving text messages. More features are in development.)
